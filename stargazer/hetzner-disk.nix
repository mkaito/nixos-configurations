  # The mdadm RAID1s were created with 'mdadm --create ... --homehost=hetzner',

  # setting defaults to '<system>' (using the system hostname).
  # This results mdadm considering such disks as "foreign" as opposed to
  # "local", and showing them as e.g. '/dev/md/hetzner:root0'
  # instead of '/dev/md/root0'.
  # This is mdadm's protection against accidentally putting a RAID disk
  # into the wrong machine and corrupting data by accidental sync, see
  # https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=606481#c14 and onward.
  # We set the HOMEHOST manually go get the short '/dev/md' names,
  # and so that things look and are configured the same on all such
  # machines irrespective of host names.
  # We do not worry about plugging disks into the wrong machine because
  # we will never exchange disks between machines.
